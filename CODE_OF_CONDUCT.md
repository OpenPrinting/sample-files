Code of Conduct
===============

Our goal is to provide quality open source software that everyone can use.
While we may not be able to address every request or accept every contribution
to this project, we will do our best to develop and maintain it for the common
good.  As part of the open source community, we expect everyone to:

- Be friendly and patient.
- Be respectful, even if we disagree.
- Be honest.
- Be accepting of all people.
- Fully explain your concerns, issues, or ideas.
